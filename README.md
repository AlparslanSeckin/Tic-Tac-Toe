//Tic Tac Toe

Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. 
Hence, tic-tac-toe is most often played by young children, who often have not yet discovered the optimal strategy.

Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship 
and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. 
It is straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or 
to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the state space complexity) or 
the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space.

//Prerequisites

-Install Java SE Runtime Environment 8.

-Navigate to folder of download file with console(cmd)

-write this command javac TicTacToe.java

-then this java TicTacToe

I used Eclipse IDE with WindowBuilder (GUI Desinger plugin) to write this application.
I will try to add simple AI and possibly convert this project into .jar file.
